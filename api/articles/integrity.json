However, the existing optical imaging techniques can only acquire the spatio-temporal or spatio-spectral information of the object. Here, we develop a hyperspectrally compressed ultrafast photography (HCUP) that can simultaneously record the spatial, temporal and spectral information of the object. In our HCUP, the spatial resolution is 1.41 lp/mm in vertical direction and 1.26 lp/mm in horizontal direction, the temporal frame interval is 2 ps and the spectral frame interval is 1.72 nm. Moreover, HCUP operates with receive-only and single-shot modes, and therefore it overcomes the technical limitation of active illumination and can measure the non-repetitive or irreversible transient events. Using our HCUP, we successfully measure the spatio-temporal-spectral intensity evolution of the chirped picosecond laser spot and the femtosecond laser-induced luminescence. This study extends the optical imaging from three- to four-dimensional information, which has scientific significance in both fundamental research and applied science.</p>\n","categories":[],"tags":[]}
